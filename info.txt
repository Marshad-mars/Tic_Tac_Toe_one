{Main structure of the game}-
    1. There must be a 6 squared grid. For the foundation of the game.
    2. "Winning patterns", required in total number is 8.
            3 for vetical patetterns.
            3 for horizontal patterns.
            2 for the diagonal patterns.
    3. (JavaScript)- Main logic of the game and functional mechanism of the game.
        (CSS)- Designing and looks of the game and the whole web-site.
        (HTML)- Structure and skelton of the whole project.
            *Frontend of the website: HTML and CSS.
            *Backend of the website: JS.
    4. The whole game would be stored inside of a container named, <div.game_container>
    5. The main focu here would be in the JS logic.
    6. It is important to know the logic of the alternate turns of the players.

    *For having a dynamic type height and width for the website, we use the suffix <vh> which stands for viewport-height.
        For eg, {height: 40vh;}. This would mean, the body or the respective div.__ would cover 40% of the height-length of the 
        respective height of the viewport page, in the aspect ratio of that particular device.
    *It is preferable to link the JS file with the html file, just before the </body>. Because it would allow the index.html to
        load at first and then the main engine of the website would be loaded.
    *For using any class typed container or an element, we use the <.> infront of the name of the container or the element.
        For using any identified container or an element, we use the <#> infront of the name of the container or the element.
    *Those arrays, which are inside of another array, are known as 2D-array. And here in this game, 2D-arrays would be specially 
        used.
    *(Event Listenner)- Boss, an event listener in JavaScript is a function that waits and responds when a specific action (event) 
                        happens on a webpage, such as clicking a button, moving the mouse, pressing a key, or loading the page; 
                        you attach it using element.addEventListener("eventName", function)
